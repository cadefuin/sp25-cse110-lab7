# Lab 7

## Check Your Understanding

1. I would run automated tests within a Github action to ensure that every change passes all the tests without going through the manual effort of running tests.

2. Yes, end-to-end tests can be useful for checking outputs.

3. Navigation tests the page loading, while snapshot tests the page as-is (does not reload the page).

4. (a) change image sizes and formats to reduce memory usage (b) use an efficient cache policy (c) minimize third-party usage (ex. fakestoreapi.com)
